## Common.Logging.Elmah (unofficial)

This is my fork of the [Common.Logging.Elmah](http://www.dotblogs.com.tw/wadehuang36/archive/2011/10/06/Common-Logging-Elmah.aspx) to continue development and provide new features.

**10/22/2013:** I have not yet spoken to the original author about licensing (the current code
does not specify), any plans he may have had, or how he may feel about my fork.

### Project requirements

* Visual Studio 2010

### Roadmap

My intial need for forking this code base is to add the current *hostname* to the data logged - in order to better troubleshoot load balanced environments.
